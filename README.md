# 说明
* 城市信息學（Urban Informatics）自翻，中文版价格实在不太讨喜，正好英文原版是在Springer开源的，所以这边像阅读文献一样慢慢更新吧，欢迎各位提issue来修正文稿。
* My own translation of the Chinese version of "Urban Informatics," originally published by Science Press, is quite expensive. Fortunately, the English original is open-access on Springer, so I will update it here slowly like reading literature. Feel free to raise issues to correct the manuscript.
* 《Urban Informatics》 PDF<sup>[1]</sup> : https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-981-15-8983-6
* 遵循Open Access
